# Electrostatic-Simulations

This tracks the movement of a charged particle when placed in a 2D box of unmoving, identically charged particles.

It prints the path of the particle to a data file which can be loaded into excel or an equivalent. Graphing the y(3rd)-column versus the x(2nd)-column plots the path which the particle took around the box.

The purpose of this program was to test my electrostatics and physics interactions so that the next step, a purely classical simulation of the double slit experiment, could be performed.
